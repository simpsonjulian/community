[2010-02-10] Write more tests
    There's basically no tests for all the functionality in the shell
    please fix it
    
[2010-02-10] Break out generic shell framework from kernel-specific code
    The shell is generic by default and can be used for anything,
    f.ex kernel (GraphDatabaseService) stuff. Now these two "packages"
    are in the same component... It'd be nice to break out the generic
    package so that it can be used for other stuff/tools as well.
