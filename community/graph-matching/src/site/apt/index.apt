The Neo4j graph pattern matching component

 This component provides means for searching for patterns in a
 Neo4j Graph Database.

 The pattern matching is done by first defining a graph pattern and then
 searching for matching occurrences of that pattern in the graph around a
 given anchor node.

* Introduction to the API

 For complete API reference, please refer to the {{{apidocs/index.html}JavaDoc pages}}.
 
 A graph matching pattern is made up of two main object types, the
 {{{apidocs/org/neo4j/graphmatching/PatternNode.html}PatternNode}} and the
 {{{apidocs/org/neo4j/graphmatching/PatternRelationship.html}PatternRelationship}}.
 <<<PatternNode>>>s and <<<PatternRelationship>>>s can be associated with actual
 <<<Node>>>s and <<<Relationship>>>s respectively, or can be restricted by a set
 of {{{apidocs/org/neo4j/graphmatching/AbstractPatternObject.html#addPropertyConstraint(java.lang.String, org.neo4j.graphmatching.ValueMatcher)}property constraints}}.
 Associating a <<<PatternNode>>> with a <<<Node>>> or a <<<PatternRelationship>>>
 with a <<<Relatoonship>>> will force that <<<PatternNode>>> or
 <<<PatternRelationship>>> to only match the <<<Node>>> or <<<Relationship>>> it
 was associated with. Adding constraints on properties will restrict that
 <<<PatternNode>>> or <<<PatternRelationship>>> to only match a <<<Node>>> or
 <<<Relationship>>> where the property with the given name matches
 {{{apidocs/org/neo4j/graphmatching/ValueMatcher.html}the defined restriction}}.
