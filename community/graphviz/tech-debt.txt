[2010-02-09] Support declarative stylings
    To work with the graphviz generator you have to write code to define
    the styling of the generated visual graph. If we had a declarative
    way of defining these, or a simple API for scripting languages,
    this tool would be more useful as a command line utility.

[2010-02-09] Support traversers in the command line tool
    At the moment the command line tool iterates over the entire graph
    and visializes it. It would be more useful to iterate over subgraphs
    defined by some traversal.
