Interaction points
==================
* Acquire lock
* Allocate ID range
* Commit transaction
* Rollback transaction (release locks)
* Slave pull

All responses have the possibility to return a number of transaction logs.


Aquire lock responses
---------------------
* ok, locked
* deadlock detected
* recoverable failure
  Master sends transaction logs and client either realizes that the resource
  is not lockable (removed) or that it could make a new locking attempt.
* nonrecoverable failure
  Transaction fails. Typically the master has died since the last sync, and
  we now have a new (or restarted) master. All transactions from before the
  last syncup are now invalid, since their locks are not held by the master.


Allocate ID range
-----------------


Commit transaction
------------------


Rollback transaction
--------------------


Slave pull
----------


Features still missing
======================
* How does a new master know if a client has had a transaction opened before or
  not? How do we differentiate from the first lock in a transaction and the
  rest of them?


Locking sequence
================
1. Acquire local lock
2. Acquire lock at master
   If fail: release local lock
   If success: proceed
